				<p style="margin-top: 0">Stuck on homework? Not understanding what the teacher is saying? Is there just too much material to cover?</p>
				<p class="emp"> <b>Don't worry! You don't need to know most of it anyways.</b></p>
				<p>Whaaaat?? I hear you cry. But here's why:</p>

				<p>1) Flash cards don't work. Not if you want to remember what you've learned after you finish the class, anyways. Developing a deep understanding of any material requires making connections to old material, not topically memorizating slews of new equations. Without any anchor, all of the new material will be easily lost, and you'll have to learn it again for your next class.  That's why rote memorization is actively detrimental to your learning.</p>
				<p>2) Once you know how the new material connects to your existing knowledge base, you can just derive all of the new material. For example, I only have about 20% of the equations used in calculus memorized. In trigonometry, instead of memorizing 32 values of sine and cosine for the unit circle, I only know 2. From just these small tidbits of information, I can derive the rest of the content using math I learned in 6th grade. That's how simple it could be for you.</p>
				<p>3) Most students' method for solve problems involves checking off steps on a list of instructions. This ultimately fails though, because if your homework or test problems don't follow the steps exactly, you're hopelessly lost. That's why you have to develop your own maps. This way of approaching problems gives you the bigger picture, and offers alternative routes if the one you're on is stuck.</p>
				 
				<p>I can help you develop problem solving techniques, and make the connections to old material that teachers never tell you about. Whether you want a deep understanding of your materials, or you just never want to memorize a formula again, I'm the guy for you!</p>
				<p>If you "just want to pass this class," don't come a knocking!</p>
				<p>I've put together some <a href="">worksheets</a> with practice problems of varying difficulties. Solutions are available for all, and workthroughs are available for the more challenging problems.</p>

			<h1>Science Demonstrations</h1>
			<p>Having a science themed party? Want to get your students excited about science? Participate in cool science experiments that you can take home when you're done!</p>
			<p>I have lectures about a all sorts of awesome topics, incorporating fields ranging from environmental science to nuclear chemistry to astronomy. These demonstrations are appropriate for all ages, no background knowledge required. The depth and detail is tailored depending on the age range; students anywhere between elementary school and college will enjoy these demonstrations. </p>
			<p>The base price includes the lecture presentation and all demonstrations. Per-participant prices depend on lab equipment and reagent costs.</p>
			<p>I also offer these lectures one-on-one without labs or demonstrations for my standard tutoring prices.</p>

							Imagine there was a dog that loved to eat shoes. All sorts of shoes. Sneakers, heels, combat boots, ballet slippers, flip flops, anything it could get its teeth on. But only the left ones. Why? How does it know? Who told it to do that?
						</p>
						<p>
							It seems strange, but that's actually how it is for all life on Earth. All of the molecules that we can use or produce are all one handed; all of our proteins are left-handed, and our sugars are right-handed. If we were given a right-handed protein or a left-handed sugar, our body wouldn't even know what to do with it! It would slip right through your digestive tract, completely undigested.
