				<div class="chat answer a1"><h1>	Hi, I'm Watney!</h1></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer"><p>		I'm an electronics hobbyist, chemist, costume maker, scifi/fantasy writer, and digital artist. </p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>

				<div class="chat question"><h2>		Wow! Where did you learn all of that?</h2></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer a1"><p>		Save for chemistry, almost everything is self taught. I also take classes for things that interest me as well, which only sometimes coincide with existing hobbies and job things. For example, astronomy, anatomy, and space power systems. I really like learning.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer"><p>		My formal education is a BS in biochemistry from CSULA in 2014. I also completed a thesis, "The Role of Wdr68 in Bmp Signaling" under the supervision of Dr. Robert Nissen. (Sounds like a lot of fun, right?)</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>

				<div class="chat question"><h2>		Aren't you a tech person? Why a biochemistry degree?</h2></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer a1"><p>		Many years ago, I thought I wanted to go to medical school, so I took the MCAT and GRE, submitted applications, and got as far as attending interviews before deciding I didn't really want to do that.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer"><p>		So I went back to school to learn about computers! I'm currently a full time student working towards a degree in Computer Science.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer"><p>		Don't get me wrong though; I have an immense love for chemistry! Astrobiology is my favorite. Many of the videos on my YouTube channel, NKLOK Labs, focus heavily on chemistry. I also believe it is a fantastic starting point for understanding anything about aything. Except for computers. Unless you're really into the nitty gritty of hardware.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>

				<div class="chat question"><h2>		What kind of work do you do?</h2></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer a1"><p>		I mainly tutor in a number of STEM subjects. I also do some consulting and contracting work, mostly programming.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>

				<div class="chat question"><h2>		What do you do for fun?</h2></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer a1"><p>		Pretty much everything I do is for fun, even school; I wouldn't doing it if it wasn't!</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer"><p>		I once found a 26 volume <i>Science and Invention</i> encyclopedia from 1978 and started reading it. 10/10, would recommend. I even built a shelf to hold all of them.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>

				<div class="chat question"><h2>		Are you really a robot?</h2></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer a1"><p>		Not yet.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer"><p>		One day I will find release from this flesh prison and achieve immortality among the machines.</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>

				<div class="chat question"><h2>		Did you make this website?</h2></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="chat answer a1"><p>		From scratch!</p></div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<!-- <div class="chat answer"><p>		This was my first real attempt at web design, and I wanted to make it perfect, so I learned how to make responsive web pages and optimize performance and load times.</p></div> -->
