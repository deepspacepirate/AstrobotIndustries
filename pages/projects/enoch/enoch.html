				<h1>Enoch</h1>

				<p>October came once more, and I didn’t have a costume. Remembering how well <a href="../fox-spirit/fox-spirit.html">my previous year’s costume</a> was received, I decided up my game. I had a few costumes to pick from and settled on Enoch from Over the Garden Wall. He's about 10 feet tall and looms threateningly, but is actually a nice fella. I’m a really short fella, so I figured this was my one chance in the year to finally be tall. Go big or go home, right?</p>

				<h2>Construction</h2>

				<p>I’d like to preface this with the fact that despite being only 19 years old, I have the body of an arthritic old man. I have a bad back, bad hips, bad knees, and bad arches. It's safe to say my body and I share a mutual dislike of each other. Given that, you can see how quickly I would run into problems with my original plan of trying to support a 15 pound costume on my back while wearing 15 pound stilts. Of course, I, ever the optimist, had to try anyways.</p>

				<p>I practiced walking in the stilts and was beginning to get the hang of it, before I realized that the weight collapsed my arches and caused a lot of pain after wearing them for more than 30 minutes. I tried getting arch supports, but they didn’t help at all. All I had were collapsed arches on top of lumps in my shoes. Wearing the burlap was physically impossible. I put a couple of ribbons of burlap on my shoulders, and after only five minutes, my lower back started to hurt. It seemed this costume was determined to make it as hard as possible for me to succeed.</p>

				<p>I ended up doing a lot of research into ways of supporting large costumes, and I discovered the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Stalk-Around-costume/">stalk-around frame</a>, to which I could mount everything. They’re easily constructed from PVC and pipe insulation foam. Even better: it's entirely reusable for other tall costumes, so the $20 cost was a write-off. Even even better: while parading around, I discovered that I had made the frame such that it actually rests on my hips; the 15 pounds of costume was supported by my pelvis instead of my back. My back was pain free the entire night. Incredible.</p>

				<h3>The Body</h3>

				<p>This part of the costume consists of incredible amounts of burlap. 30 yards of the stuff. There’s two layers of ribbon: one naturally colored and 6” wide, and the top layer, which is 3” wide and dyed green with Rit dye. The alternating colors was actually unintentional; I started the dying process outside in the evening as it was getting cold, so the hot dye started cooling very quickly. As a result, the later strips were much lighter than the first ones. But it turned out very nicely and exactly how I wanted them anyways! I didn’t even need to use my second pack of lighter green dye to get the different colors.</p>

				<p>After that, a large tree in my backyard was picked to bear the honor of ‘soggy jute holder’. It was quite a sight to behold. An entire limb of the tree strung up with so much hot wet burlap that it formed a contiguous sheet. My very clingy white dog had a great time hanging out under the tree while I was working, and ended up very green.</p>

				<p>Once dry, the ribbons were attached to a shoelace with safety pins and hung on an inverted dog recovery cone. To prevent errant gust of wind from revealing myself as the man behind the curtain, I pinned openings in the underlayer shut with even more safety pins, while still allowing most of the top layer to move around freely. This whole costume is literally held together with safety pins and shoestring. But it looks damn fine, doesn’t it.</p>

				<h3>The Head</h3>

				<p>The head is made of a 36” diameter paper lantern dyed orange. I had a hard time finding a container large enough to dye it in. I ended up borrowing the pan beneath my hot water tank, covered it with plastic, and filled it with dye. Then I rotated the ball all around in the water. Only a small amount was ever submerged at a time, but I eventually got the whole thing covered in dye. To nobody’s surprise, it was very fragile when sopping wet. Once it was completely dry, I darkened alternate panels with dye and food coloring. It’s not super dramatic, I know; I probably could have made them darker.</p>

				<p>
					<b>Total project time:</b> 35 hours over the course of three weeks<br>
					<b>Cost:</b> $90
				</p>

				<h2>The Pumpkin King of the Block</h2>

				<p>I got quite a bit of attention as I paraded around. People across the street would shout, "Look at that!" to their children/friends, and I was stopped by many trick-or-treaters for photo-ops.</p>

				<p>As a towering columnar behemoth, I was much much more commonly mistaken as decorations, and ended up getting hit more than once by several rowdy teens. Thankfully, I was quite far inside the costume, and they only hit the burlap ribbon.</p>

				<p>I would stop walking and stand on the sidewalk and pretend to be decorations. </p>

				<p></p>

				<h2>Future Plans</h2>

				<p>An interesting thing about this costume is that despite being in an enclosed space, I remained cool. This is due to the straight path out the top, which essentially acted as a chimney. This allowed hot, humid air to rise escape, drawing in cold air from around my feet. The unfortunate side effect was that the paper head got very soggy; by the end of the night, I was afraid it would snag on a tree and tear. </p>

				<p>I’m hoping to revamp my costume (if I get the time/ have the interest), particularly the head. The proportions of the head aren’t quite right; Enoch’s actual head is obling and 1.5-2x the diameter of his base, whereas mine is spherical and about the same diameter. I want to get a 50-60” diam. inflatable beach ball and cover it in batting and orange cloth. I also need megaphone to screech at rowdy teens that try to touch me.</p>
