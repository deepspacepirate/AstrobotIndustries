				<h1>Electric Avenue</h1>

				<p>You can't call yourself a electronics hobbyist if you haven't had at least one project with an inordinate amount of LEDs. This was my first major foray into DIY electronics. I spent nearly $600 in building up my workshop with all the necessary tools and accessories required. I've created a <a href="">list of high quality and affordable tools</a> for anybody interested in starting their DIY electronics workshop.</p>

				<h2>Skills Learned</h2>

				<p>The last time I touched a soldering iron was over 10 years ago when I was 8, so I really improved my soldering skills with this project. I got reasonably good at soldering SMD parts, which weren't actually necessary for the project. I just wanted to learn how to do it. I also got really good at splicing wires. My obsession with making paperclip jewelry when I was 14 really came in handy here, and I was able to make joins and repairs with wire.</p>

				<h2>Construction</h2>

				<p>Finding affordable 5mm NeoPixels was difficult; they usually run at $1 per LED, which is quite steep. I ended up buying in bulk from China: 1000 WS2812 LEDs for $200.</p>

				<p>If you ever feel stupid, just remember that I once forgot to put the converter betweeen the battery and my LED strip, and ended up running 12V across 5V LEDs and let out the magic smoke. It was really fortunate that I got the bulk LEDs instead of the American ones, or else I would have felt really bad for killing 10 LEDs in one go.</p>
				
				<p>I really hoped that I could get away without insulating the connections, seeing as the umbrella frame was enameled, but it was not to be, and I ended up frying one of the LEDs with a short. I probably deserved that anyways for shoddy electrical work. Lesson learned! I spent a lot of time thinking about what the best ways to insulate such a complex surface would be. I started with spray PlastiDip, which had an amazing finish, but it scraped off far too easily. I ended up purchasing silicone and some 18ga needles.</p>
				
				<p></p>
				<p></p>

				<p>The umbrella is made of 80 RBG LEDs zip-tied and silicone-ed to an umbrella frame. It's controlled with an Arduino Uno and powered by Li-Po batteries. To keep weight down, I used several small batteries that I would change out when they died instead of one huge battery. The lights have several patterns available, but my favorites are rainbow sweep and syncing to music.</p>
