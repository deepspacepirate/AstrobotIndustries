				<h1>Fox Spirit</h1>

				<p>Until I was 18, I was extremely lame; I had been an uncritical consumer of commercial Halloween costumes. The time had come for that to change.</p>

				<p>As I had been becoming increasingly aware of the pervasive problems with Halloween industry, my interest in it had been waning in the past few years. 

				There is an alarming lack of diversity in costumes available from Halloween vendors, and I don't just mean the fact that women's costumes are largely limited to "sexy X". (<a href="https://mashable.com/2014/10/28/sexy-ebola-halloween-costume/#7TWHZa4bLmq4">Sexy ebola nurse, anybody?</a>) Both male and female commercial Halloween costumes are pretty uninspiring, and they rarely changed year to year during my 10 year obsession with the holiday.

				I had also been an avid consumer of haunted houses, but they were becoming stale. I'd walk through houses with a bland look on my face and disappointment in my heart. Jump scares were overdone and predictable, and I had been largely desensitized to squick-indicing decorations. The fact that the realm of what people think is scary is limited to screams, viscera, and rotting flesh is a problem in and of itself. Blood and gore? More like blood and <i>bore</i>. It was all so <i>dull</i>.</p>

				<p>As a result, I had not purchased a costume yet, but with only three days left, I didn't have much time to put one together. This was my first DIY Halloween costume, and I was eager to make something that didnt follow the template of original for once. I wanted to spice it up with something different. This really marked the start of my obsession with surreal horror.</p>

				<p>(If you know of a haunted house with shifting walls, disappearing doors, labyrinthine ___, and seemingly impossible geometries, please hit me up. I want a house that inflicts the best and worst of sonic warfare technologies and just completely makes you lose your grasp on reality. Like a bad trip in the MOMA. No blood and squick, just pure psychological and surreal horror.)</p>

				<h2>Construction</h2>
				
				<p>The head really is the centerpiece of this costume. <a href="https://wintercroft.com/products/fox-mask">This fox pattern is from Wintercroft</a>, a fella who makes some really incredible low-poly masks. After spending way too much time deciding what head to wear, I spent about six hours tracing the pattern onto some cardstock, cutting it out, and gluing it all together. I actually had a lot of trouble keeping the eye holes aligned with my eyes, especially since it would slip around when I turned my head or walked. I couldn't take two steps without the mask falling down my face or coming unaligned. To resolve this problem, the inside was padded with some styrofoam at the top, the temples, and my cheekbones. I could see, but I didn't have any peripheral vision and ended up bumping into a lot of children.</p>

				<p>The poncho was made of burlap and a number of artificial flowers and leaves I got on discount from a Joann's craft store. To add a bit of flair, I attached some plaid ribbon to the back and front. I was really anxious about permanently attaching something to the wrong place, so everything was held together with hot glue and safetey pins. After pinning everything down, I realized that I still didn't have enough foliage. At that point, it was 5pm Halloween night, so I just went to my backyard to gather the longest vines I could find and pinned them to my costume. </p>

				<p>Under it all, I just wore a black robe, which was a graduation gown I thrifted, black opera gloves, and my regular street clothes (all black). I ended up with a costume that was infinitely better and cheaper than anything I could get at a Halloween outlet store *cough*Party City*cough*.</p>

				<p>
					<i><b>Total project time:</b></i> 20 hours over the course of three days<br>
					<i><b>Cost:</b></i> $30
				</p>

				<h2>Go Time!</h2>

				<p>I feel it is extremely relevant to let you know that I live in a residential area that goes absolutely nuts for Halloween--music, movies, haunted houses, elaborate props, recreations of scenes from horror movies, the works. The entire street is blocked off and it's absolutely jam packed with people. Trick-or-treaters' movements create a flow that starts on the south side; they go north on the east side of the street then head back south on the west side. It's very easy to get separated or lost in the mob, so I chaperoned two of my younger siblings while they went trick or treating.</p>

				<p>I stayed behind at the sidewalk while they went up to the house to get their candy. While they were busy, I stood on the lawn and pretended to be animatronic Halloween decorations, occasionally turning my head very mechanically to stare at passersby. When a trick-or-treater noticed me and stopped to stare, I'd suddenly rustle my bundle of sticks to make them jump. For the children that were unnerved by my facelessness, I waved a silent but enthusiastic, "Hello!" and gave them a thumbs up.</p>

				<h3>Interaction 1: Attack of the Clones</h3>
				<p>Because everybody follows the same path at generally the same speed, I ended up seeing a lot of the same people, some of whom were a group of high school students. They had seen me at two of the prior houses, where they had examined me and concluded (incorrectly) that I was decorations. Seeing me at yet another house spooked them for real this time.</p>

				<p>A: "There's another one! There's three of them!"</p>
				<p>B: "No I'm pretty sure it's the same one."</p>
				<p>C: "Is it following us?"</p>
				<p>B: "I saw it walking!"</p>
				<p>A: "Are you sure?"</p>
				<p>C: "Is that a person?"</p>
				<p>A: "Look at how it's moving. It's a robot!"</p>
				
				<p>I took all of my might to not laugh while they were trying to figure out if I just happend to be a very popular Halloween decoration that three homeowners had bought, or if I was, in fact, following them. Eventually they took to shining lights through my mask and into my eyes, whereupon they concluded that I was actually flesh and blood.</p>

				<h3>Interaction 2: Memery</h3>
				<p>Another of my favorite interactions was with a trick-or-treater who shouted, "What does the fox say?!" from across the street. (Context: it was a popular meme at the time.) Silently freaking out about whether I should stay in character, I decided that the point of Halloween was for fun. I overcame my awkwardness and screamed back the most ridiculous line in the song, "Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow!" It made me absolutely giddy to see the child run back to their mom and tell her excitedly about me.</p>

				<p>I really had a fantastic time that night. The reactions I got truly make any costume worth it.</p>

				<h2>Future Changes?</h2>
				
				<p>Due to its simplicity, this is one of the few costumes that I didn't have any improvements to make. The poncho hangs in my closet in a bag, and the head sits high on a shelf under a tarp to avoid dust. I'm not sure what to do with them now, but perhaps they'll come out another day.</p>
