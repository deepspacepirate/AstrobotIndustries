				<h1>Sad Talk</h1>

				<p>
					<i><b>Vent art:</b></i> art that someone makes to let out a feeling, usually a negative feeling like anger or sadness.<br>
					<i><b>Vent programming:</b></i> ???
				</p>

				<p>This was a vent project from many years ago, when I was 17. As a newly minted college grad with no idea what to do with their life, I had not been looking forward to Thanksgiving with the extended family. You know, one of those functions where everybody asks who you are and what you've been up to, but you have nothing good to say?</p>

				<p>After nearly three years of storage, I decided to take a look at this project again. It really is a shock to see how far I've come since then. I wanted to add a few more choice quotes to it, but it felt disingenuous to do so. I'm simply not in the same headspace I was three years ago, and don't have the same well of feelings to draw from anymore. However, I still admire my 17 year old self's ability to succinctly convey a complete mood in just a few words. The project has remained largely untouched since then, save for <!-- a link to the National Suicide Prevention Line and --> some responsive CSS I added just now. <a href="depression.html">The project is available here.</a></p>
