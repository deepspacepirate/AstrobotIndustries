			<div class="answer a1 cf"><h1>	Hi, I'm Watney!</h1></div>
			<div class="answer"><p>		I'm an electronics hobbyist, chemist, costume maker, scifi/fantasy writer, digital artist, and amateur astronomer. </p></div>

			<div class="question"><h2>	Wow! Where did you learn all of that?<div class="triangle"></div></h2></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	Save for chemistry and astronomy, <emp>everything is self taught</emp>. I like learning.</p></div>
			<div class="answer"><p>		My "official" education is a <emp>BS in biochemistry from CSULA in 2014</emp>. I also completed a thesis, "The Role of Wdr68 in Bmp Signaling" under the supervision of Dr. Robert Nissen.</p></div>

			<div class="question"><h2>	Aren't you a tech person? Why a biochemistry degree?</h2></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	Many years ago, I thought I wanted to go to medical school, so I took the MCAT and GRE, submitted applications, and got as far as getting interviews before deciding I didn't really want to do that.</p></div>
			<div class="answer"><p>		So I went back to school to learn about computers! I'm currently a full time student working towards a degree in Computer Science.</p></div>
			<div class="answer"><p>		Don't get me wrong though; I have an immense love for chemistry! Astrobiology is my favorite. Many of the videos on my YouTube channel, NKLOK Labs, focus heavily on chemistry.</p></div>

			<div class="question"><h2>	What kind of work do you do?</h2></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	I mainly <a href="">tutor</a> in a number of STEM subjects. I also do some consulting and contracting work, mostly programming.</p></div>

			<div class="question cf"><h2>	What do you do for fun?</h2></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	Pretty much everything I do is for fun, even school; I wouldn't doing it if it wasn't!</p></div>
			<div class="answer"><p>		I once found a 26 volume <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Works-Illustrated-invention-Encyclopedia/dp/B000KFSARU"><i>Science and Invention</i></a> encyclopedia from 1978 and started reading it. 10/10, would recommend. I even built a shelf to hold all of them.</p></div>

			<div class="question"><h2>	Are you really a robot?</h2></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	Not yet.</p></div>
			<div class="answer"><p>		One day I will find release from this flesh prison and achieve immortality among the machines.</p></div>

			<div class="question"><h2>	Did you make this website?</h2></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	From scratch!</p></div>
			<div class="answer"><p>		This was my first real attempt at web design, and I wanted to make it perfect, so I learned how to make responsive web pages.</p></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	Don't let the minimalism fool you; it was a deliberate aesthetic choice! This was a labor of love!</p></div>

			<div class="question"><h2>	</h2></div>
			<div class="answer a1"><p>	</p></div>
